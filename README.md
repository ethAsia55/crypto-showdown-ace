## 🎮 How It Works

### 1. **Game Creation**
- Players create encrypted poker games
- FHE encryption keys are generated
- Game state is stored on-chain

### 2. **Hand Encryption**
- Each card is encrypted using FHE
- Players can only see their own encrypted hands
- Community cards remain encrypted until revealed

### 3. **Secure Gameplay**
- All actions (bet, call, raise, fold) are encrypted
- Game state is verified without revealing private data
- Zero-knowledge proofs ensure game integrity

### 4. **Reveal & Settlement**
- Hands are revealed only at showdown
- Winners are determined fairly
- Funds are distributed automatically
